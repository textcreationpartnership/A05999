            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Though not to lay the ground-work or Principles of Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:1201:3"/>yet to be fellow-workers with <hi>GOD</hi> and His holy Apostles, is now the glory and rejoycing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Word in theſe latertimes. Amongst the reſt a ſincere, faithfull, and judicious Divine in theſe Workes of his never yet before extant, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Honours view and approbation. His abilities were ſuch as became a Succeſſour of a worthy and religious Predeceſſour, in his miniſteriall function in the Vniverſitie of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by him performed, unto <hi>GOD's</hi> glory, the good of others, and his owne comfort. The firſt he unfainedly deſired and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the utmoſt ſcope of all his endeavors, that <hi>GOD might be glorified by him both in life and death:</hi> the ſecond as ſubordinate to the other, hee procured, not ayming at his owne advantage ſo much as their ſalvation that heard him, <hi>not ſeeking theirs, but them.</hi> The last was an effect of the two first, this muſt needs be a conſequent where the others are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent: for, <hi>GOD forgets not our labour of love,</hi> to Himſelfe, or others. Senſible experience hereof had this holy man, who found much comfort by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in himſelfe, and by the fruits of it in others. There be many that ſpend much time in ſtudying, <hi>are never weary in wel-doing, are inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon;</hi> but with how ſmall ſucceſſe! for it is <hi>in vaine to riſe early, and ſit up late,</hi> except

Hee prayed, and his prayer was heard: hee wrestled with <hi>GOD</hi> (as <hi>Iacob</hi> did) and overcame Him. Hee fulfilled his deſires and granted his requeſts, and made him a ſpirituall Father of many children by him begotten unto <hi>GOD.</hi> Should I ſay more? I will adde this only: what in him was praiſe-worthy, let it be applauded; what was in him for Inſtruction and a godly life, let us imitate: Let us learne of a dead man to live. Dead doe I call him? <hi>Though the body die by reaſon of ſinne, yet the ſpirit liveth unto GOD, through IESUS CHRIST</hi> our <hi>LORD.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learne of him to live ſpiritually, that with him we may live eternally. I have ſhewed in ſome ſort what hee was, and what it concerneth us to be. And this the rather, preſuming of your Honours favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance, not ſo much of him that Dedicates theſe following Expoſitions, as of him by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement hee was encouraged thereto, his worthy friend, Your Ladyſhips humble ſervant; that for his

                     <p>The reaſons of it may bee taken partly from the great aboundance of light which is in the Goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the old Scriptures, they being as a <hi>Candle</hi> in a darke place, which could not caſt its light farre, and therefore was bounded within one Nation: This being like the Sunne for cleereneſſe, ſpeading forth the beames of it more aboundantly, but in vaine the Sunne ſhineth to blind men: The principall cauſe therefore was in the abundance of the ſpirit powred forth upon the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                        <hi>that we have ſuch an one to be our King and</hi> SAVIOUR, <hi>who is God with the Father.</hi> Thus much is laid downe in this ſpoken of this <hi>Sonne,</hi> that <hi>He is the Image of the inviſible God:</hi> this phraſe indeed is ſpoken ſometime by man, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Man is the Image and glory of God;</hi> though there onely: for we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1201:43"/>are ſaid to be made <hi>according to the image of God,</hi> not <hi>to be the</hi> Image of <hi>God:</hi> But we muſt underſtand theſe diverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; when ſpoken of this deare, well beloved, proper, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten <hi>Sonne,</hi> naturall <hi>Son;</hi> and when of us that are made ſons by grace of adoption through faith on Him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. He hath the ſelfe-ſame inviſible God-head or divine nature with the Father: Wee have onely created qualities, which have ſome proportionable reſemblance of Him. When I ſay Prince <hi>Charles</hi> hath the King his Fathers Image, I meane one thing; and when I take a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſay, this money hath the Kings Image on it; the one is a picture having ſome reſemblance, the other is a naturall Image that hath the ſame ſubſtance. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. He is called the <hi>brightneſſe of His glory, and the expreſſe Image of his Perſon.</hi> And beſides, that it is cleare by plaine teſtimonies elſe-where, wee may convince it out of this Text; for He is ſo the Image of <hi>God,</hi> that He is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Creator of all creatures: this then is the matter of praiſe, that we are in ſuch a Kingdome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not man, but <hi>God</hi> is King. <hi>Iſrael</hi> the type of us, they had Kings indeed, but all of them were fleſh, ſerved their times, and dyed: But our King is <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Throne is for ever; this the men of <hi>God</hi> fore-ſaw and rejoyced in, <hi>Thy God reigneth, O Sion,</hi> &amp;c. And in truth this is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it which doth ſo credit this kingdome of ours, this is all the glory of our Iſrael. Wee ſee in earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes the Perſons and qualification of Princes is the chiefe grace and ornament of them: This doth augment the felicity of England, that <hi>God</hi> hath given us ſuch a King ſo graced with mentall endowments; a great Potentate and moſt Chriſtian King: if <hi>God</hi> had given us one, though of obſcure parentage, it had beene a bleſſing, but much obſcured even by this circumſtance: So if that noble qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1201:43"/>of the perſon ruling hath this force in earthly States; what a thing is this, that we have one annointed over us, who is <hi>God</hi> over all?

We ſee the more excellent the gifts are, as the ſtrength, wiſdome of our King, the more awfully they are reſpected, the more obſequious we are to them, the more confidently we promiſe our ſelves all things under their regiment. Looke at <hi>Salomon:</hi> one part of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome made feare fall on all Iſrael; ſee their ſubjection, though he taxed them heavily, yet none durſt quitch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: What ſhall we be to our <hi>God,</hi> who in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement was greater than all <hi>Salomons?</hi> This ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to have obſerved out of the ſcope.</p>

He that ſeeth this or that body, hee ſeeth the man, though he ſeeth not the ſpirituall nature in man, becauſe he ſeeth that viſible nature, which is a part, and belongeth to the perſon of man: So, who ſo ſeeth this viſible nature of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> may be ſaid to ſee <hi>God,</hi> though he ſee not the inviſible Godhead, becauſe he ſeeth the nature which is joyned in unity of Perſon with <hi>God.</hi> 2. By looking at the divine workes which this man wrought, we come to conceive of the God-head in this Perſon; as in His giving ſight to the blinde, raiſing the dead, ſtilling the Sea, I come to ſee that He is Almighty, a quickening Spirit.</p>

<list>
                           <item>1 His creating all Creatures.</item>
                           <item>2 His antiquity and being before all Creatures.</item>

                     <p>But theſe words are doubtfull. Two principall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are theſe: the one, that theſe words note <hi>Chriſts</hi> eternity, begotten before all Creatures, of the <hi>Father,</hi> by eternall generation. Secondly, theſe words may ſignifie Him to be Heire of the Creatures, the <hi>Lord</hi> of them, by a metonymie of the ſubject for the adjunct, the right of inheritance and dominion belonging by <hi>God</hi>'s Law to the firſt begotten: and this I take to be the true meaning, for theſe reaſons. 1. CHRIST's eternall exiſtence before all Creatures, is laid downe in the next <hi>Verſe</hi> ſave one, in plaine words. 2. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> conſtrueth this being the firſt begotten, as having this annexed, the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over other. 3. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.2. Hee is ſaid to be <hi>made heire of all things,</hi> and this followeth; <hi>For by Him all things were created,</hi> as a reaſon both of His being the naturall <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and true Heire; as here the ſame words are ſet downe to prove Him the Eſſentiall Image or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the firſt begotten, that He is Heire or <hi>Lord</hi> of all the Creatures.</p>
                     <p>Marke for explication, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how that He is ſaid the <hi>firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of all the Creatures; Iſrael God</hi> calleth His <hi>firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> ſending to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to diſmiſſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> His <hi>Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> So <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.33. all the elect are called <hi>the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten;</hi> but this is ſpoken of them in compariſon of the inferiour creatures and reſt of mankinde onely. 2.

                        <hi>What a wonderfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit this is, that we are made ſubjects to ſuch a King;</hi> who is the <hi>Lord</hi> of all the Creatures: what can we want that are under Him who is the Heire of all things? What can hurt us, who are His ſubjects that is <hi>Lord</hi> of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

Wee muſt make uſe of this.</p>
                     <p>And firſt learne to be thankfull to <hi>God,</hi> glad of it; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> we have cauſe to be glad that we have a King ſet over us, who is <hi>Lord</hi> of all the Creatures in heaven, earth, and hell.</p>

So it is with us; firſt all property is in <hi>God</hi> of all things, they are His owne, Hee may doe with them at His pleaſure. 2. <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> doth give to His naturall <hi>Son,</hi> made manifeſt in the fleſh, all the Creatures, making Him <hi>Lord,</hi> and giving Him all judgement in heaven and earth, under Himſelfe. 3. CHRIST the naturall <hi>Sonne</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> doth take ſome out of mankinde as brethren to Himſelfe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them ſtate of inheritance, as who by faith on Him are become joynt heires with Him: To others He giveth of His Creatures, partly to teſtifie His patience and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie; as the King giveth allowance to traytors in the Tower, till they are to be brought to execution. 2.

We muſt not ſupply Him with vice-miniſteriall heads: How needeth Hee one in His roome, who is not only preſent; but beareth up and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all the Creature? It is true that CHRIST doth admit (though preſent) the miniſtery of men with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yea, when Hee was in His man-hood upon the earth, He did aſſociate ſuch as laboured under Him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them calling; but a miniſteriall Vice-roy through His viſible Church, is a thing the Scripture nor ſound Antiquitie acknowledge not: But CHRIST His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is abſent. As if Kings cannot governe all their Countreyes, though their Perſons be at their Court one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: How much more our King who is with us in Spirit, where two or three are gathered in His Name?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there can be no miniſteriall head; for the work of miniſtery CHRIST hath beſtowed not upon Popelike monachs, but upon <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.</note> Againe, none is able to doe theſe things which the nature of an head inforceth, as to quicken us, to governe us by internall influence; which when the <hi>Papiſts</hi> confeſſe no man can doe, why ſhould they inforce an head under CHRIST, as Kings have viceroyes under them: for a Lord Deputy can doe what the King in perſon ſhould doe; but no man can doe what the Head of the Church is to doe. Againe the Wife is next in authority to the Husband; the Church viſible is the ſpouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not one man; but the whole Church hath all authority next to Him. Is it fit the Wife ſhould be kept under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1201:55"/>of a flagitious ſervant? ſuch as the Papiſts grant Popes may be. Let us therefore take heed, that while we ſet up other heads then <hi>Chriſt</hi> over the Churches, we doe not reject this glorious Head <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> from ruling over us: as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they refuſed that Ariſtocraticall governement in which <hi>God</hi> ruled, and would have a King like other Nations; the Lord charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not only to have caſt off <hi>Samuell,</hi> but himſelfe: and what is more fooliſh then to thinke it needfull to have a viſible univerſall high Prieſt on earth, becauſe CHRIST is in heaven inviſible to us touching His cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preſence? ſhould the people of Iſraell have erected another High Prieſt to themſelves, when <hi>Aaron</hi> was at any time in the Holy of Holies, where he was not viſible to them? ſo we ſtand here below in the entry, our High Prieſt is but gone into the Holieſt Sanctuary, and we though His Divine nature be with us, will ſet up another. Sooner ſhall the heaven have two Suns, then the Church two heads: and though metaphorically one may be ſaid to be the Head of a Church, for the name of <hi>God</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is thus Communicable, yet in proper analogy none can be ſo termed: For then the Church might be ſaid His body properly; which is ſuch ſacriledge, as He, I thinke, in whoſe forehead blaſphemy is written dare ſcarce commit. A double head and a double husband become not the Church: the latter is not for her hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the former fitteth not to decency. Thus much who is over us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Marke from this,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> that He is called <hi>the Head of His Church; what neere compaſsionate and beneficiall ſuperiority or authority that is which Chriſt hath over His Church.</hi> He is the Lord of all Creatures, yea the helliſh fiend muſt bow the knee to Him. But He is not an head to every
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1201:55"/>creature, if we take it in that proper analogicall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation which the Scripture looketh to in this terme. The head hath the higheſt place and power in the body; but yet it is ſo intimately conjoyned with every member, ſo amiable and beneficiall a ſuperiority, that the like cannot in nature be ſhewen.</p>
                     <p>For firſt looke at the head; it is by ſinewes and other ligaments ſtraitely conjoyned to every member: ſo is <hi>Chriſt</hi> through the ſpirit of faith coupled with us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly from this union the head commeth to have a ſenſe, if any part be diſturbed: ſo hath <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He knoweth how to compaſſionate our infirmities; <hi>Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou Me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the head what ever it hath, hath in a ſort for the good of the body. The perfect comlineſſe of the head, is the ornament of that body whereof it is the head; the body being but a deformed trunke if the head be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved. Againe, the ſenſe and motion which are ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the head as a fountaine, they are derived from it to every member.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The head giveth full direction to the other members: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our glory; He quickeneth us, He giveth us direction both inward and outward.

Now all of them may be here underſtood, for they are all antecedent qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fitting him for this worke, which in the next words is mentioned, eſpecially the firſt.</p>

                     <p>As likewiſe it teacheth where to offer prayſe for the meaſure of grace we have received; we ſhould be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as receivers, in thankfulneſſe to GOD, in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards men; For <hi>what have wee that wee have not received?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, this is very comfortable, for if there be ſuch a fulneſſe in CHRIST, then what though there be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſinne in us and guiltineſſe, yet there is a fulneſſe in Him to remove it, and take it away; a fulneſſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to heare our ſupplications, a fulneſſe of merit to make a full atonement for our fouleſt ſinnes, a fulneſſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevaile with His <hi>Father</hi> in any requeſt; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be ſuch a fulneſſe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as there is, be not diſcouraged: though thy ſinnes abound, yet his grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds much more, they cannot be ſo out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as he is mercifull. Remember but the two metaphors in Scripture, <hi>I will ſcatter your ſinnes as a miſt: I wil drowne them in the bottome of the Sea.</hi> Now the Sunne, by reaſon of his force, can ſcatter the thickeſt miſt, as well as the thinneſt vapour: and the Sea, by reaſon of his great vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, can drowne mountaines as well as mole-hils. So CHRIST, by reaſon of the great vaſtneſſe of grace that is in Him, is able, yea, forward and willing to forgive the greateſt, as well as the leaſt ſins; For mercy though it be a quality in us, yet it is a Nature in <hi>God;</hi> now that which is naturall, there is no unwillingneſſe nor wearineſſe in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as the eye is not weary of ſeeing, the eare is not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1201:61"/>weary of hearing: therefore though our ſinnes be never ſo great and many, His grace is all-ſufficient for the pardon of them. Now I beſeech you take not this exhortation in vain; for there is nothing more effectual to heale a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, and to cauſe a ſinner to change his courſe, than to bee fully perſwaded that hee ſhall be received to mercy, and that his ſinnes ſhall be forgiven him in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore let this fulneſſe of mercy in <hi>Chriſt</hi> be an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall motive to us all to come in, and to give up our ſelves wholly to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſerve Him with perfect hearts all our dayes.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1201:70"/>ſend one of his favourites to a poore creature in priſon, how would it comfort him? but to ſend his ſonne, hee would thinke it unſpeakable and tranſcendent love: The LORD IESUS hath done much more than this; He came down from heaven, where He ſate at the right hand of <hi>God,</hi> and is now bleſſed for ever, he ſuffered here by moſt wicked wretches the curſed death of the Croſſe; that Bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe ſhould be accurſed, that Life it ſelfe ſhould dye, that Glory it ſelfe ſhould be aſhamed, that Happineſſe ſhould become miſery; Nay, yet to goe further, that He ſhould be content to loſe for a time the ſenſe and feeling of the love of His <hi>Father,</hi> not onely to forſake His being, but thus to be tormented for a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of traytors; He that bare up the whole frame of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was ſcarce able to beare the burthen of our ſins, but was even cruſhed under the waight thereof, in that Hee was forced to cry, <hi>My God, my God,</hi>

                     <p>And ſecondly, how little worth ſuch a reſolution is, without a carefull uſe of the meanes, may appeare by the example of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who having a ſtrong reſolution not to deny CHRIST, yet fell into it for want of uſing the meanes, in a very groſſe and ſhamefull manner. And this reſolution and uſe of the meanes, is that in effect which the Apoſtle teacheth and requireth in the two words following, where he ſhewes the cauſe and meanes of this continuance, by two compariſons: The firſt is taken from the foundation of an houſe, grounded or founded, teaching that a wiſe builder firſt ſeeketh a good ground, and layeth a ſure foundation, and there buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth boldly and ſafely upon it; <hi>For though the winds ariſe, the raine falles, and the flouds beat upon the houſe, yet it falleth not, Matth.</hi> 7.

But the joy conceaved at the cauſe of them, and the honour God vouchſafeth to us in them, ought to ſwallow up, or at leaſt overcome that ſorrow.

                     <p n="3">3 Their faithfulneſſe and diligence appeares in their manner and kinde of preaching, both teaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; which is the duty of every Paſtor: for it is a ſmall thing to informe the underſtanding with doctrine, except alſo the heart be reformed by exhortation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of admonition is one kinde, and here put for all; and it goeth well with us when we can be reformed by both.</p>
                     <p>The manner alſo of performing theſe things, declareth their diligence and faithfulneſſe, namely <hi>[in all wiſdome]</hi> for as the Word of CHRIST ſhould dwell amongſt us richly <hi>in all wiſdome, Col.</hi> 3.16.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1201:89"/>age, ſex, condition, applying the Word unto them accordingly: for to the Paſtor the Word of wiſdome is committed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. The ſhepherd may not feed or drive the young lambes and the ſtrong ones of the flock, alike; neither may the Miniſter deale alike with the weak and ſtrong.

                     <p>The want of this wiſdome in the Miniſter, oftentimes brings his miniſtery into contempt, and his perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hatred, danger, or both.

                     <p>Finally, the end which they propounded to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all their labours, proveth both their diligence and faithfulneſſe; for it was, <hi>That they might preſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man perfect in</hi> CHRIST IESUS, that is, <hi>That they might be filled with knowledge, faith, and holineſſe;</hi> which the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. calleth a perfect man,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1201:90"/>and one that is come to a ripe age, and full growth and ſtature in CHRIST. <hi>This then ought to be the ſcope of every mans miniſtery, to beget men to</hi> CHRIST <hi>by the immortall ſeed of the Word;</hi> and to nouriſh and feed them more and more, till they come to a perfect growth: to initiate and to enter men into CHRIST, and by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to perfect them, that ſo they may preſent them perfect unto GOD, in CHRIST IESUS. Eſteeming that they have never done their duty, till they had preſented them perfect men in CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>Now how great labour and care, diligence, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity is to be had to worke ſo great a worke?

There is reporting of kindneſſe, which out of proud diſpleaſure upbraydeth thoſe to whom we ſpeake, and this begetteth unthankfulneſſe in them whom we have pleaſured. There is againe a reciting of that we doe, out of religion, love and wiſdom, which begetteth further love in thoſe who heare it: Out of religion (I ſay) for it is to <hi>Gods</hi> glory; that we ſhould tell ſuch things, as not we ſo much as His grace worketh in us; eſpecially when He doth ſo ſtand by us, that we are called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and ſtrive in prayer with him, in prayer for the good of any. Out of wiſdom, as when it breaketh the neaſt of ſuch as labour to ſlander us behind our backs with others. Out of love to <hi>God</hi> and my brother, when I tell it that

                     <hi>God</hi> may have glory from my brother knowing it, that his confidence may be ſtrengthened, that his love to me may be further kindled: thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reciteth that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. He doth not ſimply proteſt his love to his Country men, but doth bind it with an oath, that he might mollify their diſpleaſure, and wind in with them. Yea we read of the Saints, who before <hi>God</hi> have orderly and holily made appeale how they have walked before Him. Though therefore ſuch as either proudly, or out of unadviſed levity, or contumeliouſly ſound out their owne praiſes, are not to be juſtified; yet neither on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand muſt we cenſure all ſpeeches of this nature: a mans neighbours may dwell ſo farre off, or be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, that hee that would keepe ſilence in this kind, ſhould betray <hi>Gods</hi> glory, the truth, his owne honour and neighbours ſafety.</p>

So when we heare that our heavenly Father hath begotten Himſelfe other children here or there; though we have not ſeene them, yet we ſhould in all love embrace them, and ſeeke their well-fare; yea there was great need why he on whom lay the care of all the Churches, ſhould pray fervently for theſe; becauſe theſe might (even in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard) more eaſily be ſeduced, as who had not knowne him and ſeen his converſation, who was the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for ſuch as knew what kind of man he was that delivered theſe things, were hence ſomewhat ſtrengthened and encouraged in their way.</p>

He were a graceleſſe child that would never pray for his Mother; and we would thinke he would doe little for us that would not lend us a good word here or there: So when we remember not the Church, and will not open our mouthes one for another to <hi>God,</hi> what love is there? Let us therefore frequent this duty, not in word or ſhew, but in deed and truth. From the practice of this duty it commeth to paſſe that a Chriſtian is like a rich Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who hath his factors in divers Countryes: So a Chriſtian hath in all places of the world ſome that deale for him with <hi>God,</hi> that never ſawe his face, who are petitioners for him unto <hi>God.</hi>

                           <item>1 The thing it ſelfe.</item>
                           <item>2 The antecedents or meanes leading to it.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>The thing is, <hi>that their hearts might bee comforted at
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1201:100"/>the knowledge of the myſtery of God the Father and of Chriſt,</hi> that is of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which told them that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt God-man</hi> was made light and ſalvation to them, as to other <hi>Gentiles:</hi> for the incarnation of the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> and the calling them to be a people who before were none, were hidden myſteries, till <hi>God</hi> reveiled them. Now to this end he prayeth, <hi>that they might be knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love, and a more full knowledge, having with it full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of perſwaſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The better to underſtand it, we muſt remember that theſe <hi>Coloſsians</hi> were brought by Epaphras to know the <hi>Goſpell</hi> in truth. Secondly, you muſt know that they had love, yea true love. Thirdly, that they did not feele the joy of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſo plentifully as others, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through the Divels tares of diſſenſion, there was not that ſoundneſſe of love which ſhould make them ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe though they knew the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> yet they knew it not ſo plentifully, being in part ignorant of their Chriſtian liberty, of the all ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſole mediation, as who looked and liſtened a little to the helpe of Angells this way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, from hence it came; that being weake in knowledge, they ſomewhat ſtaggered: the Apoſtle therefore wiſheth them the taſt of heavenly joy more fully in that they knew, and to this end wiſheth that all impediments of heavenly joy, as diſſenſion, doubting, ignorance being remooved, they might be one in love, rich in knowledge, and fully perſwaded and reſolved in the things they knew.</p>

                        <hi>Co-workers with</hi> GOD <hi>furthering your joy:</hi> this he prayed for,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.10.12.</note> this he made the intent of his journeyes, to give, and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them.

                        <hi>hee diſpatched meſſengers to comfort their hearts.</hi> True it is, that ſometime they are forced to make ſadde, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> but this is not their principall intent: for they doe this, not for it ſelfe, but that it may make way for rejoycing; as a Phyſitian is forced to make his Patients ſicke, that thus he may reſtore him to health.</p>
                     <p>There is great reaſon for this.</p>
                     <p>We are bound every one by the Commandement that ſayth, <hi>we ſhall not kill,</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 Againe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew how many things the Saints have to preſſe them downe, through the malice of Sathan, and keepe them from knowing the ſweet fruit of the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He knew that this was a friendly Sunne, which maketh all graces thrive the better in the heart where it is.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That if GOD ſhould not refreſh them this way by letting them feele this power of that life which is to come, they were in danger to ſhrinke from <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the midſt of ſuch diſcouragements, with which this world abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: For as we ſay, without this, <hi>vita</hi> is not <hi>vitalis,</hi> no man liveth, or can live without a delight and joy. As we ſee kind men, when they taſt a thing that pleaſeth them more then ordinary, will invite others to taſt it with them: So the Communicative love of this Apoſtle was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1201:101"/>ſuch, that finding in his own experience what a ſoveraigne thing this was, he could not but wiſh it unto others.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Laſtly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that this was forcible to draw others to the profeſſion, when men ſhould marke this in it, that it filled thoſe that imbraced it, with gladneſſe of heart, and that in the midſt of the greateſt evils, by ſeeing the joyfulneſſe of ſuch who were converted.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it is a ſlander of ſinfull men that thinke a Preacher of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> killeth all good company, <label type="milestone">

So there be others that are affrayd to enter into <hi>Gods</hi> way, leaſt they ſhould come out of <hi>Gods</hi> comforts: theſe are like the ſpies that brought an ill report of the good land: <hi>it was a good land and fruitfull, but there were Gyants, Anakims,</hi>

There is a wonder in Spaine, of a river that runneth fifty miles under ground: this river though it be ſometimes unſeene, yet it is continuall, and it breakes out againe: So the conſolations of GOD are ſometimes unſeen, not onely of others, that goe away ſadde when they ſee us want the comforts of GOD; but alſo to our ſelves, the <hi>Lord</hi> hiding the ſweet Sunſhine of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from us, which is yet in the skie, and giveth ſome meaſure of light to us; like as the Sunne, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it be darkened, yet there will be a time of reviving againe.</p>

There is a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1201:102"/>joy that men are aſhamed of; ſuch is the joy of ſinners, that have overgrowen the controle of Nature it ſelfe.

What a baſe joy is this, that men are aſhamed of? Such is the joy of all naturall men, compared with the joy and rejoycing of a ſanctifyed man; it is baſe and contemptible joy. He can goe no higher then to rejoyce in his riches, becauſe he is rich; in his eaſe, and that he hath a good houſe: he feeles no evill, money comes in apace, trading laſts well, and the like: a poore baſe joy.

For Satan ſtriveth nothing more than to disband the Church, we being knit by ſinewes; if he can but cut the ſinews of love and doctrine, and croſſe it, he hath enough. And as light vapours or exhalations, being drawne up from the earth, come downe with great tempeſts; ſo from light differences in opinion (if not a great meaſure of grace) doe proceed often great ſtormes, and tempeſts of wrath and envie.</p>

For the avoiding of this impediment or ſtumbling block, let Chriſtians follow the Apoſtle in his exhortation in matters of religion and opinion therein; he would have them labour to <hi>be of one minde,</hi>

If ſhe love him but little, ſhe taketh but ſmall joy, but the more fervently ſhee loveth him, the more abundantly ſhe rejoyceth in enjoying of him: So with us, the more we get up to love CHRIST and His, the more ſhall we rejoyce in our Vnion and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one with another: Hence it is that when knowledge ſhall be perfected in fight, and when love ſhal be abſolute, lacking nothing, then our joy ſhall be full in the higheſt degree of it.</p>

So for aſſurance, it is weake in Chriſtians; even as babes ſo hold this or that, that they may bee eaſily brought to bee of another minde: So a

In the third place, for underſtanding; how ignorant a great while were the Apoſtles after the beginnings of grace in them? As the underſtanding in civill things, it commeth not all at once, but is little in child-hood, and ſo getteth up as yeares ripen: So it is in the babes of GOD: Yea, our want of giving aſſent, and confident reſting upon that GOD revealeth, doth keepe us from underſtanding; for beleeving things upon <hi>God</hi>'s Word, which I am not able to underſtand, at length I come underſtandingly to know thoſe things, which above that I could conceive, I religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly beleeved.</p>

                        <hi>Who is the ſtore-houſe of all wiſdome and knowledge;</hi> namely, <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord.</hi> We know the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury is it, from whence we fetch for all occaſions: Our treaſuries are ſtores ſufficient to furniſh our particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities: So <hi>God</hi> hath made <hi>Chriſt</hi> a treaſury and ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, as of all other ſpirituall gifts, ſo of wiſdome and knowledge, that from His fulneſſe every member might be ſerved: The Spirit of wiſdome and knowledge reſted upon Him above meaſure. As the light is fully in the Sunne, that Moone and Starres might thence borrow: So the fulneſſe of this, and every ſupernaturall gift is in Him, that thence it might be derived. There is as in <hi>Chriſt</hi> a double Nature, ſo a double treaſure of wiſedome and knowledge. The firſt is uncreate, that omniſcient wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>God,</hi> which knoweth perfectly, and fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the divine Nature; and not only all which have beene, are, and ſhall be hereafter, but all things which are poſſible to be done, if <hi>God</hi> were ſo pleaſed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is, as the nature of man, ſo proportionably a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1201:109"/>created wiſdome and knowledge, whereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>God</hi> more fully than all the creatures, though not ſo fully as <hi>God</hi> may be knowne, and is knowne of Himſelfe. For a finite nature is not capable of an infinite, ſo as to comprehend it; for nothing can receive above that which it hath capacitie to receive.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Hee knoweth in <hi>God,</hi> as in a glaſſe, all things which have beene, are and ſhall be, ſo farre as agreeth with His happie eſtate, and the execution of His Offices which are committed to Him. Thirdly, Hee knoweth within Himſelfe, and by experience above all that can be uttered; for Hee is filled with theſe gifts not onely for Himſelfe, but that He might ſend from Him into all His members. <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore as man, though He know not <hi>God</hi> ſo fully, as <hi>God</hi> is knowne of Himſelfe, and know not all things which are poſſible to be done; becauſe this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be knowne, but by a full comprehenſion of GOD's omnipotencie, which being infinite, no finite nature can fully comprehend; yet His knowledge is above all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Angels and men, and is unmeaſurable after ſome ſort, though not ſimply infinite, that from it all of us might be ſupplyed.

Hence it is that <hi>they count the preaching of</hi> CHRIST <hi>a fooliſh thing;</hi> for affecting depth of wiſdome, it is ſo hid that they cannot eſpie any ſuch thing in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yea, from this hiding it commeth to paſſe, that in ſome philoſophicall ſubtilties, they ſeeme to finde farre greater knowledge than in all that is told of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, our wants doe make it not ſeene to us; though
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1201:110"/>we beleeve it, yet we behold it not preſent: For though we are made wiſe, yet it appeareth not how wiſe we ſhall be; as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in another caſe, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>We know in part,</hi> and great are the reliques of folly which dwell with our wiſdome. Now as we ſay of a man who having great wealth, and yet maketh no great ſhew, he is a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den man: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> not manifeſting this abundance of wiſdome in us His members, is ſaid to have it treaſured up, and hidden within Him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let us not bee offended at the ſimplicitie which now is in CHRIST, <label type="milestone">

Though theſe things we have revealed are ſuch wiſdome, that all knowledge beſide is fooliſhneſſe unto them, yet the things we know are nothing to that which ſhall be revealed in us. Nay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould not be wiſe, if he did otherwiſe: A man that is of the greateſt learning in the world, when he teacheth an <hi>A. B. C.</hi> man, he doth not runne over his Tongues and Arts; but only applieth himſelfe to the capacity of his ſchollar, keeping the other within himſelfe, till his ſchollar growing riper, ſhall be fitted to receive them: So doth our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> deale with us; we are Grammar ſchollars, not yet taken to that Vniverſity of the Saints in glory; and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of wiſdome doth keep hid in Himſelfe thoſe treaſures here named.</p>
                     <p>This is a comfort to us, <label type="milestone">

We ſhall in time have it. If we knew not ſome ſecret which we deſired, yet if we had ſome friend, that knew it, who ſhould further tell us, that he in time would ſhew us all the matter, it would make us reſt the better contented: Thus it is with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we have great
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1201:110"/>wants in knowledge, but Hee hath all treaſured in Him, and will in His time make us know, as we are knowne. And thus this doctrine might be paſſed over. But the Papiſts doe hence gather, that even <hi>Chriſt</hi> new borne had the fulneſſe of wiſdome. But the Anſwer is, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not of the Man-hood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> only, but his whole Perſon.

While He was in ſtate of humiliation, He did grow up in wiſdome; both His habits being more confirmed, and His experimentall knowledge to His end encreaſing in Him: He knew not the barrenneſſe of the Fig-tree, the day of judgement, not only in this ſenſe he knew it not to tell us: True it is, He was anointed above His Brethren with joy, wiſdome, &amp;c. but hence it followeth not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He was actually forthwith having all joyfull bliſſe and wiſdome: For CHRISTS anointing ſignifieth three things:

For as if one hold out a thing unto me and ſay, it is thus and thus; my ſight, and conceiving what it is, without reaching my hand to it, doth not at all receive it: So while faith with the eye of it looketh on, and conceiveth what GOD offereth, but

The offer of an almes from a rich man is a warrant ſufficient for a poore man to receive it: The free offer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to a ſinner is warrant ſufficient unto a ſinner for to receive <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is not then for a poore ſoule when he would ſettle the firſt ground of his faith, to looke for ſomething in himſelfe that ſhould make him worthy of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but in this buſineſſe there is nothing to be done, but for a man to goe out of himſelfe, and to take <hi>Chriſt</hi> with an empty hand, as He is offered; that is, to ſave ſinners, to ſeeke the loſt, to heale the wounded, to feede the poore: The ſenſe of nakedneſſe and poverty is warrant enough for a man to receive <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This being well underſtood will be very avayleable to ſettle the faith of Chriſtians, to keepe them from wavering in believing, whereunto they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Sathans malice; they cannot thinke Chriſt will ſave them, GOD will not looke upon them, GOD will vouchſafe no ſuch priviledge unto them, becauſe they are poore, blind, and naked: But I ſay, for that cauſe receive

                     <p n="3">3 All is not done when the judgement is informed that Chriſt is the onely Saviour, and a perfect Saviour without any act of ours concurring to merit ſalvation; there is another thing to be added which muſt faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the affections: <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be received with the whole heart; not onely with the underſtanding, but the will and affections, the whole ſoule muſt incline to it, thus to reſt onely upon Him, to prize Him onely for Himſelfe, faith fixeth upon the perſon of Chriſt, and takes all other things as conſequents deduced from that which is in Chriſt: So the joy of a Chriſtian, the delight of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the love of a Chriſtian, ſhould bee fixed onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt.</p>

Take Him thus: expect not onely peace by Him, but truth alſo; nor knowledge of the truth onely, but life alſo and ability to walke in obedience to that truth: thus you muſt receive whole Chriſt; not only as a Saviour to free you from the wrath of God, but alſo as a Lord and King to rule over you and to guide you.

                        <item>2 Our conſtant courſe bringeth us hitherto, that whereas we were wavering, touching the points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and <hi>God</hi>'s grace, as they were taught us; we (I ſay) conſtant by walking in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> come to be ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in all the matter of faith, as we firſt learned it from faithfull teachers.</item>
                        <item>3. This ſhall accompany your proceeding in Chriſt; that we ſhall abound in our perſwaſion of doctrine, and GOD's grace toward us.</item>
                        <item>4. That better knowing the things beſtowed on us, and eaſed of our doubting, which unbeliefe excited, wee grow to unfained thankfulneſſe for CHRIST and His benefits.</item>

                     <p>
                        <q>Continue in the faith you have begunne in, and live according to His will, and through His ſtrength on whom you have beleeved, growing by this conſtant perſevering to be more neerely knit to Him, rooted and builded; more fully perſwaded of the doctrine, as it hath been taught you, for meaſure more abundant both in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confidence; finally, heartily thankfull for ſo great things given you of GOD.</q>

                        </label> out of the coherence; <hi>What fruit we get by conſtant going on in</hi> CHRIST; <hi>we come to have more
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1201:120"/>firme conjunction with Him.</hi> When a young plant is newly ſet, the roots are of ſmall depth in the earth, one may well pull them up with an hand, but as the tree ſhooteth up in ſight, and bearing fruit, ſo it ſtriketh the roots deeper and deeper downward; yea, both together, though it be not perceived: So that no force can move it: So in a building ſtones new laid while the morter is yet greene, may be pecked out; but when the cement is dried, and they are ſunke downe, and throughly ſettled upon the foundation, they are more cloſely joyned to it, then they cannot be eaſily moved: So it is in us; wee have not for degree ſo firme and neere conjunction with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the more we live in Him, like good trees ſpreading in the ſight of all men, and bringing forth the fruit of righteouſneſſe, the more we come to take root downward by a more firme confidence, which doth bring us to have a firmer conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and more neere union with Him. Our Vnion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto that which uniteth us. As the cauſe is in degree greater or leſſer, the effect is anſwerable: Now at the firſt faith is weake, like a bruiſed reed and ſmoaking weeke; but while Faith holding <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doth draw the Spirit from Him, which maketh it fruitful in good works; the more it exerciſeth, the more it is ſtrengthned: even as in babes, their powers every way at firſt are feeble; but the more they feed and exerciſe, the more they waſte the redundant moiſture, which before enfeebled their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and put forth ſtrength in all their operations. Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when faith was weake in him, at the voice of a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell was ſhaken: by walking in Chriſt awhile, he was ſo rooted, that threatnings, whippings, impriſonments, conventings before great power, martyrdome, nothing could ſhake him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, let us walke on without fainting, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1201:121"/>in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> this will bring us further and further into <hi>Chriſt.</hi> What if thou ſtandeſt not ſo firme? what if little winds ſeeme to ſhake thee? goe on, thou ſhalt grow rooted in him thou knoweſt not how; yea, while thou doeſt thus (though thou ſhakeſt) thy root doth ſtrike lower and lower into <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Many are moved to think how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are faſtened, how ſlenderly they are rooted in Him, but to be rooted is not every beleevers ſtate, I mean thus deepely rooted: this is the condition which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine who have long walked in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what then if Chriſtians be not at firſt rooted? <label type="milestone">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1201:121"/>attained the firſt day; <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe my unbeleefe:</hi> Faith is mixed with doubting at the firſt; but in progreſſe of time we come to out-grace this wavering, of which all beleeving hearts complaine at times juſtly: This was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> prerogative, <hi>he was fully perſwaded</hi> of that GOD had promiſed him, without once making queſtion of it. There is no man learneth any Art, who at firſt can ſee how every thing is true, which others skilfull therein tell him; but <hi>oportet diſcentem credere;</hi> beleeving that which his maſter ſaith, and going on with it, he commeth in the end moſt fully to diſcerne, and be perſwaded of all things: So it is in this Art of arts, and ſo much the more, by how much it is the more divine, and ſurpaſſing all naturall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity than others. When a man recovereth ſome long ſickneſſe, and beginneth to walke; he walketh with great feebleneſſe and faintneſſe: but going on in exerciſe and diet, nature overcomming the remainders of ſicke matter which were left, he goeth ſtrongly, and feeleth not his former imbecillity. So when <hi>God</hi> healeth an unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart, there are at firſt ſuch reliques of unbeleefe as make him full of doubting; but going on in CHRIST, the Author and Finiſher of his faith, GOD doth ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his faith, that it ſubdueth this contrary forme; ſo that the man walketh confirmed in thoſe things which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved ſometime very waveringly.</p>

Who that ſaw a linke beaten againſt a wall, would not thinke it would be put out? yea, this tendeth to make it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1201:122"/>burne more clearely: So thy faith thus knocked with theſe doubtings, ſhall when it getteth up, be ſo much more confident.</p>

What is the cauſe of this? O thou haſt not yet walked obediently after the rule of CHRIST; therefore GOD giveth thee up to darkneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As yee have beene taught] viz.</hi> As you have beene taught by <hi>Epaphras:</hi> Note hence, a point of wiſdome in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and mutuall honour, confirming and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing <hi>Epaphras</hi> a faithfull labourer. Which is our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for imitation: the honour we owe our brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it: the love we beare the truth, doth require wee teſtifie for it; yea, the care of others ſalvation doth move us every way, to make <hi>God</hi>'s wholeſome truth gratefull to them. For men of note having heard ſome of leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation preaching after them; it is not amiſſe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to their matter and ſayings, and mention them with honour.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it ſeemeth inſinuated hence, that the Divell did a little move them to unbeleefe, even from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though they doubted not of the Goſpell; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he taught it, or no, it was true that might be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned: which if it be; wee may ſee that continuing in faith and obedience, will make us out-grow ſuch carnall exceptions, at which ſometimes we ſtumbled. If the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell cannot bring us to ſay, the meat is naught, yet he will make us to thinke it is not aright handled, the Cooke is not as he ſhould: Thus many thinke, though they cannot
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1201:122"/>gain-ſay the matter, why the man is no great ſchollar, no Doctor in ſchooles, he preacheth plainly, not a teſtimony of Fathers, nor ſentence of any Author. Well, if thou haſt an honeſt heart, goe on in CHRIST, and theſe things ſhall vaniſh. This by the way.</p>

If we doe any thing of things indifferent, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any thing, it is good to abound in the perſwaſion of it. A man cannot truſt <hi>God</hi> too much; a man cannot goe too farre in this which doth glorifie <hi>God,</hi> and put to His ſeale that He is true, and good in all He ſpeaketh to us. We muſt therefore endeavour it. Beſide, as waters a while dammed downe that they could not have courſe, when once they breake thorow, they over-flow all farre and wide: even ſo doth Faith borne downe a while with doubting, ſo much the more abundantly breake out, and drowne all ſcruples in us: Or as fire long ſmoothered and ſmoaking, at length breaketh out with flames that touch the skie, and like another Sunne enlighten the ayre; So doth true faith, when it ſwimmeth from under theſe waves of doubting, which ſometime over-whelme it.</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1201:123"/>nay. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Goſpell, and this faith he calleth for, which did root them in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

You ſee in babes, though their parents doe hang never ſuch rich jewels and bracelets upon them, alas they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thanke them, for they know not how they are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but let them come to ſome knowledge, and give them a thing, then they will a little thanke you; but let them grow to ripeneſſe of underſtanding, and give them ſome great pretious things, they will be much affected. Two things breed thankfulneſſe; the one knowing that the benefit is of worth: The ſecond, that this thing ſo knowne, muſt be given and received. Now knowledge and aſſurance that all the benefits of CHRIST are made ours, theſe are faith; and as they doe grow from one degree to another, ſo thankfulneſſe followeth, even as the ſhadow the body, anſwering proportionably.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1201:123"/>pardon of ſin, whether hee hath them in truth, or whether thoſe he have be counterfeits. Say one ſhould give mee a Diamond, but yet could not know poſſibly whether it were a Cheſter-ſtone, not worth twelve pence could I be thankfull? Nay we muſt know for what firſt by their leave. Againe, ſay one ſhewed me a thouſand pound, but would not let me know he would give it me, only leave it upon a peradventure; could a man be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this? Nay, we would ſay, I will thank you when I have it. If we have it not in poſſeſſion or certaine hope, it is as nothing to us.</p>
                     <p>We muſt be ſtirred up to encreaſe our thankfulneſſe to GOD for theſe mercies: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we are thankfull in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are nothing, compared with theſe.

Precepts of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which muſt bee obſerved, that wee may goe on in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from the beginning of the third <hi>Chapter</hi> unto the eighteenth <hi>Verſe.</hi> The firſt ſort beginning in this <hi>Verſe,</hi> is firſt ſet downe generally to the ſixteenth <hi>Verſe,</hi> after
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1201:124"/>more ſpecially to the end. In the generall prohibition we firſt ſee the dehortation: after the reaſon. The dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation containeth two things:
<list>
                           <item>1 The evill they were to avoid.</item>
                           <item>2 The meanes of breeding the evill.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt, <hi>Let none make a prey of you;</hi> that is, carry you away who are the ſheepe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from His fold, the true Church, into their owne, which are Synagogues of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that is the force of the Word. The meanes tending hither are two:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> which doth Synechdochically note all humane wiſedome unſanctified, with the doctrine it teacheth, and the ſhew it maketh.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Vaine deceit,</hi> which might ſignifie ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Logicke: but this is a principall part of Philoſophie. Some thinke it to be thus meant, Philoſophy, which is vaine deceit; but the conjunction doth ſhew that here a diſtinct thing is meant: therefore I take <hi>vaine deceit</hi> here for all religious rites which carnall wiſdome inventeth, and obtrudeth, called ſo; firſt becauſe they miſſe the end of pleaſing <hi>God,</hi> at which they ayme: Secondly, they are empty of that grace being not ſanctified by GOD, which they ſeeme to have, and therefore are empty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; in which regard Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth theſe rites diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by <hi>God,</hi> and affected by men, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>beggerly elements;</hi> not having a jot of true grace of the Spirit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and no doubt but this is here meant: For the Apoſtle ſpeciſying the things after which are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20.22. he hath the interceſſion of Angels, and the Iewiſh rites, which ſome would have put upon them, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; the reaſon taken from the originall quality of theſe things, which is ſet downe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſatively thus: Theſe things come from man, they are
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1201:124"/>carnall and worldly, not after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, having Him their Author, not ſpirituall. And firſt theſe words doe ſeeme to intimate whence theſe things come to have ſuch efficacie of deceiving; even from hence, that they are countenanced with humane authority, and are for their quality carnall and worldly things. 2. Here is a reaſon included thus: Thoſe things which are not after the rule of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we muſt not follow, who have received Him, and profeſſed that wee will walke in Him: But Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie and empty rites of religion, are after mans wiſdome and the world, not after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> therefore wee muſt not let any deceive us with theſe things. In the <hi>Verſes</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to the ſixteenth <hi>Verſe,</hi> is a double proſyllogiſme proving the firſt part of this reaſon (for the ſecond is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over as evident) it ſtands thus:</p>
                     <p>That which is not after Him in whom is all the <hi>God-head</hi> perſonally, that you muſt not receive:</p>
                     <p>In CHRIST is all the fulneſſe of the <hi>God-head</hi> perſonally:</p>

                     <p>But how can three perſons be one in nature?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, we are content to know it is ſo, though how it is ſo, we know not: <hi>aſpici Deus poteſt, introſpici non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> Though why not three perſons in one nature, as well as three Natures in one Perſon, which is in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> A bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, a ſpirituall, created as His ſoule, a ſpirituall increate: And as the ſame light is originally from no other, in the Sunne, and ſecondarily by communication in the ray or beame of it: So what hindereth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>He doth dwell perſonally in Him,</hi> that is ſo, as that GOD the SONNE is thereby become perſonally man, as he was from all eternity perſonally <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Spirit:</hi> the <hi>God-head</hi> ſo dwelleth in this man, that with the man-hood, it maketh but one Perſon, even as the ſoule and body in man make one man: So this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and humane are now joyntly but one Perſon of CHRIST: He which was a compleat Perſon from everlaſting, in fulneſſe of time creating within His owne Perſon a ſingular body and ſoule, ſuch as we have (ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) as a ſubſtantiall part of His Perſon, not a part, which made up the Perſon of <hi>God,</hi> as before imperfect, but a part; becauſe a new thing ſubſtantially, that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally aſſumed to that which before was perfect: thus much this word <hi>[Bodily]</hi> or perſonally, teacheth; For it putteth a difference (1) betweene <hi>God</hi> dwelling in every thing as an efficient and preſerver of them; (2) betweene His dwelling in the Saints and Prophets, by His aſſiſtance and workes of grace in them.

As the Arrians abuſe the ſimilitude in the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> when CHRIST is ſaid to be <hi>the Image of His Father,</hi> they gathered that therefore Hee had not the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with Him: for we ſee a mans image or picture is not of the very ſame ſubſtance with the man whoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it is, not diſtinguiſhing betwixt naturall things properly ſo called, and theſe artificiall ones which are but reſpectively and abuſively ſo termed: So here <hi>Nestorius,</hi> Loe, ſaith he, GOD dwelleth in CHRIST man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not perſonally united with man, For a man is no part of perſon with the houſe he dwelleth in; not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing betwixt common inhabitation, and that which is perſonall. But we ſee here the Text is plaine, that He ſo dwelleth in this Nature, that it is eſſentially, or ſubſtantially united to Him, as a part of His Perſon.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1201:135"/>could not elſe ſee how they could make up one Perſon. The <hi>Monothelites</hi> granted two Natures, but one action: For they could not ſee how divers actions would not conclude that there were many Perſons: But marke, the divine Nature dwelleth in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Now the inhabiting and the inhabited are not confounded; therefore both the Natures and their actions are diſtinct; and if there were ſuch a ſwallowing up of the humane Nature, then fleſh were made <hi>God,</hi> not <hi>God</hi> fleſh, by force of the Vnion. As for diverſity of Perſons, it doth not follow upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of actions; for there may be as well three actions in one Perſon, as there are three Perſons all having but one action. If the multiplicity of action did come from the number of Perſons, then there ſhould be three ſeverall Wills in the Trinity.

                     <p>The pen is an externall inſtrument without the perſon of Him that uſeth it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but CHRIST's humane Nature is an internall inſtrument united within the Perſon of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> as a part of His Perſon; as the body of a man is to his ſoule; yea, more nearely: for death ſevereth this, but not the other: yet in this they are like, that one is the effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the thing written is properly and efficiently from the Scribe, from the pen inſtrumentally with effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of inferiour degree: So theſe divine workes which CHRIST the Mediatour worketh, the chiefe vertue, and action which properly effecteth them is in <hi>God,</hi> not communicated really with the other Nature, though it doth worke them in this humane Nature with it; yea, and by it, as a moſt neerely conjoyned inſtrument, which

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1201:145"/>and put away from us.</hi> This is thus gathered; he ſaith they were circumciſed, that is, had the body of ſin put off them, while they were together buried with Chriſt, which baptiſme ſignifieth and ſealeth up in them: from this then we come to put off ſins, that we are ſet into Chriſt dying, and buryed for the aboliſhing of ſin: and hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth that we cannot live in ſin, as formerly we did, and have to doe with it, becauſe we are dead to it, being ſet into Chriſt dying, and that by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. The reaſon is, becauſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath by his death killed the ſin of all that belong to Him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as are ſet into His death, they cannot but feele the death of this body of ſins which before lived in them. Even as when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and dyed to the life of God, all of us in him are dead, and ſo ſoone as we come actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be members of him, we feele the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> death, even this, that being dead to the life of God, we lye in the ſpirituall death of ignorance and luſts: So CHRIST the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> He dying to aboliſh ſin, even that He might be the death of ſin in all His mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and lying buried under it, that He might ſo aboliſh it, as never to riſe againe. Briefly then: <hi>Adam</hi> a roote of mankind finning, brought death upon all His. 1. By bringing imputation of ſin. 2. Extinction of the life of grace. 3. A propagation of death in ſin and treſpaſſe. Chriſt ſtandeth as a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in the perſons of all given Him to be His members, and having their ſin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Him, (1) He doth take away the guilt of it. (2) Dyed to ſin, and lay under it in our nature, that we by vertue thereof might dye to it; the omnipotent ſpirit of Chriſt working through that death in the behalfe of all His the death of the creature, ſo farre forth as by the juſt judgement of God, it hath a power through Sathans
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1201:145"/>working to draw us from God to it ſelfe. (3) A death of our corruption; <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.15. <hi>By the Cxoſſe of Chriſt,</hi> the world is crucified to me, and I to it, that is, by Chriſt crucified. Briefly; as <hi>Adam</hi> becomming mortall and dying to this mortall life, wee all ſo ſoone as wee are borne members of Him, are mortall, and tend to death by force of that mortality in the roote of us: So Chriſt dying ſpiritually to this world, and the ſin of all us His members that thus they might be aboliſhed, we ſo ſoone as by faith we are made His members, or are borne of Him, we begin to dye ſpiritually, till in death we are fully mortified by vertue of that radicall death in Chriſt our Saviour, who dying according to his fleſh, did ſo worke by His omnipotent ſpirit, that as the guilt was at once remooved; ſo the life of it was mortified, that it loſt the raigne, and was ſucceſſively to be aboliſhed in the being of it, in all thoſe who by faith ſhould come to be engrafted into him, or all thoſe who ſhould ſpiritually deſcend from Him. (4) Laſtly, He brought into our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſupernaturall life, that ſo He in our nature might propagate it to all who were His.</p>

Wherefore if wee feele no life but that we brought from our mothers wombe, let us caſt downe our ſelves, we have not yet truly believed: and we ſee how our faith doth not ſhut out good life, as the Papiſts ſlander us, but bringeth it forth as an effect which cannot be ſevered.</p>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1201:155"/>that is, the HOLY GHOST to dwell in them by the created gifts of grace, which is life ſupernaturall; <hi>They ſhall heare my voice who are dead, that is, they ſhall beleeve, and they ſhall live.</hi> (3) CHRIST doth ſucceſſively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this life, never leaving till He have in ſoule and body conformed us (for our module) to His bleſſed Soule, and glorious body. And theſe may ſerve to open this point of beliefe. The difficulty of conceiving it, commeth hence. 1. That we know not how ſtraitly and neerely we are united to Him: for as all were within the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> by the determinate Counſell of GOD to come from Him: ſo all the Elect by GOD's predeſtination and donation were within CHRIST, as one in Him, and with Him. 2. Wee are not able to ſee that vertue of His reſurrection.</p>

                           <item>1 The Prieſt ſhould more properly forgive than <hi>God,</hi> though he doe it as a Miniſter from <hi>God:</hi> As the King doth not judge cauſes in triall formally, but by his Iudges in Courts, who have the power from Him, though hee doth it, in ſome ſort, becauſe he giveth the authority, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth it, and upholdeth the execution of it.</item>
                           <item>2 If <hi>God</hi> gave power to Prieſts as Iudges to abſolve, that they had authority within themſelves to doe this, then they could not fitly be ſaid to pray to <hi>God</hi> to forgive thoſe they abſolve; as for example: The King giveth his Iudges power to heare cauſes of this or that nature, and to ſentence them: now what a folly were it for a Iudge who hath, <hi>per demandationem,</hi> power from the King to order this or that, to petition to the King to order it? would not the King ſay, though of your ſelves you have no power; yet, is not the Law in your hands? have I not given you power within your ſelves, and am I not ready to ratifie what you determine?</item>

                     <p>Firſt, becauſe it is a perſonall royalty which <hi>God</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give to others, unleſſe He would make Himſelfe an underling to others, and ſo ſuſpend Himſelfe upon man, that His pleaſure ſhould ſway Him: For the forgiving of

                     <p>Secondly, this is ſuch an act wherein no man can be a competent Iudge, as man may be in cauſes betwixt man and man, which are civill: becauſe a man cannot know certainly the truth of faith and repentance in any, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which the ſentence muſt be pronounced, if truely. All the Miniſters can doe, is to certifie what <hi>God</hi> doth, not as a private Chriſtian doth, but as a publike meſſenger, who bringeth from <hi>God</hi>'s Majeſty the word of Pardon, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Word of reconciliation,</hi> that thus he may excite the faith of the penitent beleever to behold <hi>God</hi> pardoning him, and feele the pardon of <hi>God</hi> as it were, ſealed within him. My Lord Chancellour doth not give the Kings pardon, (which he giveth to thoſe that come to take it forth at his firſt entrance) he doth not, as a Iudge, give them forth as his pardons, but delivers them as the Kings ſole deed, out of his Princely clemencie: Thus the Prieſt in the Law did not make a Leper cleane, but did manifeſt him to himſelfe, and to all Iſrael to be that he was: The Miniſter of <hi>God</hi> hath no power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but miniſterially he doth co-operate with <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>God</hi>'s pardon may be applied and ſealed within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of them that beleeve.</p>

                     <p>This is to be noted againſt the Papiſts; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they ſay <hi>God</hi> forgiveth all ſinnes fully in Baptiſme, only after Baptiſme <hi>God</hi> forgiveth not veniall ſins; and if we fall into mortal, <hi>God</hi> forgiveth for CHRIST, the eternall puniſhment, but leaveth us to ſatisfie the temporall: Thus when <hi>God</hi> forgiveth us not all our ſins, but ſins committed before Baptiſme, not all after, but mortall only, nor mortall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in regard of the eternall puniſhment; thus they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the Charter of all the Chriſtian world, that they may maintaine their merchandize of Pardons, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies: But this were to make <hi>God</hi> no pardoner, but a mitigater of puniſhment.

If a debter doe know his debt is anſwered, yet hath his bonds and bills uncalled in, he is ſtill in feare; but when he hath all ſuch things as might ſpeake any thing, croſſed, torne, made utterly void, then he is ſafe: for the LORD will have man doe all things, ſo as he may ſhew his true meaning and wiſdome in the dealing betwixt him; and our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> doth give us example: for in CHRIST anſwering our debt, it had not been wiſdome not to have defaced, and aboliſhed
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1201:161"/>all ſuch things as made acknowledgement of our debt, and in GOD to have taken from His CHRIST ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for us, and kept with Himſelfe ſuch things which might witneſſe us ſtill indebted to Him, had not ſo agreed with that ſingle, and upright meaning which GOD ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all His wayes.

                     <p>The uſe of this is firſt to teach us the great bounty of <hi>God;</hi> yea, and to ſhew us a patterne of ſincere dealing: <label type="milestone">

Now we muſt know, that when we ſay this Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was aboliſhed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the meaning is, that it doth not binde any unto obedience: As we ſee with us, when Statutes are repealed, they are not blotted forth of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and aboliſhed from being monuments of advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but their force only taken away from conſtraining

For as the Morall Law is taken away from the uſe of ſeeking righteouſneſſe in it, yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth as a rule of manners, inſtructing us in our duties, which we owe in thankfulneſſe: So this Law is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in regard of all the obligation, and exerciſe of it; but remaineth for many uſes, of doctrine, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

Goe not after Philoſophy, and vaine deceit, after the tradition of men, and elements of the world; the which generall prohibition hath beene propounded, and by reaſons hitherto enforced. Now he commeth to ſome particular prohibitions, which doe open unto us what things he meant by <hi>vaine deceit,</hi> which leaneth on mans tradition and is carnall. The dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are two-fold:

                        <hi>Let no man condemne you in theſe things</hi>] The Reaſon, they are ſhadowes of things, which now in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His Church are exhibited: for this hath a ſecret force enforcing what by the Apoſtle is urged:</p>

                     <p>Therefore paſſe not, though you be condemned for omitting theſe.</p>

The ſecond ſenſe, <hi>Let none condemne you</hi>] that is, doe not take up theſe ſhadowes, or continue the practice in them, and ſo give occaſion to other Churches of the Gentiles to condemne you; but this, though a good ſenſe, I doe not allow for theſe reaſons:

Another gueſſe is, that this came out of the Philoſophy Schoole;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1201:176"/>for the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> we know did worſhip Angels; yea, and ſoules departed of ſuch as had beene Worthies amongſt them, they worſhipped at the monuments of them.

Beſides theſe things, it is like in other Epiſtles, if they that contended for the Ceremonies had brought in this doctrine with them, it is likely that the Apoſtle would have confuted it, and encountred it as well as the other: I doubt not therefore, but it is to be reduced to the Philoſophie above named: Now this being in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice with them, they condemned the Chriſtians in it, as not uſing it in their going to GOD. The Chriſtians (as is probable) liſtened to it (ſuch was the learning of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons it had) more than was meet, and were ſomewhat damped: the Apoſtle therefore doth ſtirre up their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fortitude, exhorting them not to care what any judge againſt them in that matter, for they are in the right that yeeld not unto it; the LORD only is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped religiouſly, and wee have no mediatour to Him but IESUS CHRIST. <hi>Epiphan.

                     <p>Againe the truth is, no direction which is dependent is the direction of a head; as the hand leading and drawing up the foote directeth it, but is not a head to it, becauſe the direction of the hand commeth from the principality of the head reported unto it. As for thoſe inſtances: Firſt a Viceroy is in a body politique; but CHRIST in calling Himſelfe a head of his body, doth draw the compariſon from a body Naturall. Againe the proportion is not kept; for to have a Viceroy under a King in ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is one thing, but to have a head under a head is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: For a head is to the body as a King to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Now to have another King in a kingdome under the Chiefe, is a thing unheard of. The union of the Church the Scripture teacheth to depend on CHRIST and His ſpirit, not on a viſible head. Yea the <hi>Grecians</hi> continew to this day their rent from the Church, and all for the pride of this head. Men have many names pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly attributed to them, and theſe above repeated, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly: but the names of head and husband the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and all ſound antiquity appropriate unto Chriſt: Kings may ſuffer men to be called Noble, Wiſe, Rich, but to be called Kings within His Kingdome, is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: for there is nothing more derogatory from the glory of his Crowne: ſo here <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, a whole body, is put reſpectively, for that whole frame of the body which conſiſteth of all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers beſide the head: and thus alwayes it is uſed in the Scripture; for the body is ſpoken of, as diſtinguiſhed by oppoſite relation, from the head: now when the body is ſpoken of as a diſtinct thing from the head, the head cannot then be comprehended under it: thus here the whole body increaſeth. <hi>Chriſt</hi> our head hath all fullneſſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore is not meant in the whole body.

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.3</note> This is to be marked againſt ſome Papiſts, that ſay they make not the Pope head of the whole body, but of the myſticall body which ſtandeth of men, <hi>Chriſt</hi> excepted, and this they thinke not abſurd. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelfe is not the head of the whole body in that former acception, but onely of His body myſticall, beſide Himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Some againe thus reaſon:</p>
                     <p>He that is head of a whole body, he is head of a body having a head beſide him: for elſe (ſay they) it were not a whole body: But <hi>Chriſt</hi> is head of a whole body beſide Himſelfe. The firſt part is falſe, or the ſecond, if not rightly underſtood according to the diſtinction above named. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is head of a whole body not abſolutely called <hi>(whole)</hi> as comprehending a head within it; but reſpectively ſo called, becauſe it is whole, for a body diſtinguiſhed apart from the head. For the ſecond thing, a body may be ſayd the body of one two wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the whole Perſon in whom it had or hath being: thus we ſay of one buryed, here lyeth ſuch an ones body, meaning the whole body that had the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall being of it in ſuch a man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The body is ſayd to be the body of one in regard of reference it hath to the head, as a diſtinct eminent part diſtinguiſhed from it: thus we ſay, ſuch a man is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly wounded in his body, but his head is not touched: Now though we have our myſticall being from Chriſt, yet the Scripture calleth us his body for the reſpect we have to Him as our head; as being another more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part; who with us maketh up that whole myſticall man <hi>Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> And therefore Chriſt is as properly ſayd to be our head as we His body. Now though this
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:1201:182"/>or that body may be ſayd ſuch a perſons body; yet the perſon cannot properly be ſayd the head of ſuch a body. Theſe things being premiſed, to exclude Popiſh errors, and to helpe us in the true conceaving of this matter, wee will come to the doctrine.</p>

They differ alſo in the ends which moove the one and the other to refraine: Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, they doe it, to vaunt themſelves of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then others have attayned, to purchaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a naturall liberty of mind in ſuch conſiderations as by Nature it reacheth: Sometime for politique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, becauſe hee is not counted fit for government who is ſubject to ſenſuall paſſion. The Papiſt he doth it as a part of perfection, as a thing in it ſelfe pleaſing <hi>God,</hi> as a point of merit with <hi>God:</hi> But a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hee doth refraine for the kingdome of heaven:
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:1201:194"/>how? not to deſerve it by ſuch courſe, but that by this courſe done in faith, he may ſubdue his luſts, and kill them, for it is their death not to be obeyed, and that hee may have more freedome in <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice.</p>
                     <p>For the manner of doing it, the one doth it out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometime; for as Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Eunuchs, ſome are by nature ſo;</hi> the ſame may be ſaid of abſtinence: Some by Nature are averſe from that liberty in dyet which others affect: But all beſides true Chriſtians doe it out of their owne ſtrength: whereas a true believer, he doth it by the ſpirit of GOD, bewayling his weakeneſſe, ſeeking to Chriſt for his ſtrength to crucify theſe things to him, and him to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A Chriſtian doth not abſteyne for the thing ſimply prophaning that, but from luſt ſimply, that he reſiſteth the thing ſo farre forth as his luſt taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by that which is in it ſelfe good. Now unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers looke not to inward luſts ſo much, nor cry not downe them, as they vilifie the things themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
                     <p>Hence is a third difference: the faithfull doe not make a ſet exerciſe, upon ſtinted times onely to refraine or totally at once renounce the touching them; but dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they feele themſelves tempted, they reſiſt, eating with thankeſgiving, when they feele themſelves not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, they ſo refraine, that they know their refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſelfe doth not commend them to GOD (for if not eating and drinking were in it ſelfe more holy than eating and drinking; <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſhould have been more holy than CHRIST) but as through the working of GOD's <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is to them, being weake, a meane of their more firme cleaving to GOD. Now all other
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:1201:194"/>extoll the thing it ſelfe, and reſt in it as a matter of great perfection.</p>
                     <p>In the effect following they may be diſtinguiſhed: for the one have by their exerciſe greater confirmation of an externall morall habit; the other true ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> death of ſinne, and life of grace promoted in them.</p>
                     <p>To teach us that we bee not beguiled, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> nor yet have theſe externall exerciſes in admiration, which ſuch as know not the power of godlineſſe abound in often: yea, we muſt be wiſe to diſtinguiſh things that differ; for the Divell in his will play the Ape, and imitate what GOD doth worke ſoundly in the hearts of His choſen.</p>
                     <p>This muſt provoke us to fight in right order againſt ſenſuall luſts: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Shall naturall men and others led in error be thus abſtinent, and in their faſhion ſubdue their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall appetites; and ſhall wee who have CHRIST with us our ſanctifier, lye downe as conquered of them? <hi>Plato</hi> ſuperſtitious; Popiſh wretches will condemne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians, who feed their hearts in whatſoever they deſire.

                     <p>Now if you take the end of it, ſounding to the firſt ſenſe: Obſ. 1. <hi>That exerciſes much regarded with men,</hi>

In which the Papiſts had need to conſider, who follow GOD too too much with ſenſible things, and thinke they take Him, becauſe they affect us.</p>
